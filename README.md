# moonpie
Immediate Mode-ish UI Library for UI with Tests

## Motivation

After reviewing some other GUI libraries out there for Love2D, I realized I should not write another
one. And, I also realized, that we needed one with a solid test base so that it was easier for others
to modify and understand.
